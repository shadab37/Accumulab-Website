								<h3>Our Service</h3>
								<p>Accumulab is a platform geared to streamline and simplify all of these processes for a University and Research Institute by creating an end-to-end ecosystem that will provide access at the lowest level of data from the researchers themselves by having them use the application to log and track all of their research easier and more effectively, and also this information flows up the hierarchy allowing the organization as a whole to be able to make decisions on budgeting and tracking ROI proficiently and intelligently. <br />
								<br />

 
								Other players in the space have identified a gap in the market around tackling the complexity and pace of research, thus they have built solutions specific to certain needs. But a larger hole exists around this top to bottom connectivity that would enable all of these other solutions to work more resourcefully and have a larger impact for each institution. That is why we have selected universities and research institutes as our customers as the Accumulab platform would enable them to remove the hurdles that exist thus far that prevent such entities from delivering value at the pace they should be. No other solution in the market is currently addressing this exact need. <br />
								<br />

 
								This implementation of Accumulab would by itself save an estimated 10% of research budget, which amounts to $25 million per year in the NYU example, this comes from cost minimization, increased efficiency and newly discovered revenue streams due to better usage of time. On top of this as we solve this issue internally at each institution we enable more active collaboration and communication which can scale between locations creating a means of interconnectivity never before seen in the academia space.

								<h4>Our Story</h4>
								<p>The Accumulab team comes from a primarily STEM background, each of them with years of experience in their relevant fields. For them, the problem they are tackling is not only personal, but something they all witnessed happen with their colleagues. As such, the drive to improve research is not just a venture, but a personal mission. </p>
